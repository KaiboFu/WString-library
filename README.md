This String library is a Arduino-like string library which will run well in Arduino, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black. The usage is completely  compatible with that Arduino(Also adding some convenient functions).
Arduino Uno may be the first board for those hackers, and the libraries of it are simple and easy to use, especially the String library. Rasoberry Pi and Beaglebone Black will be the best choices for people who want deep much into the geeks' world. So the WiringPi and WiringBone libararies come, they are Arduino-like libraries and will help people familiar with Arduino get started quickly with Rasoberry Pi and Beaglebone Black. But it is such a pity the above
libraries donot include the Arduino-like String class, so we just do it. We think this library will be a good supplement to those two libraries.
